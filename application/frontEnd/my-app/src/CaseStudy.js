                    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>

                    <h2>Challenges</h2>
                    <p>
                        During COVID, Dave, a leader for Boy Scouts of America in Silicon Valley, saw a drop in scout activities and motivation. He needed a way to showcase scout achievements online to keep everyone engaged.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Solution</h2>
                    <p>
                        Dave signed up for TeamMate and created an organization for all Silicon Valley troops. He used the group category to organize each troop, imported all awards, and began assigning scouts to their respective groups and awards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Realizing it was too much work alone, Dave invited his friend Chris to join as an administrator. Together, they managed the scouts' groups and awards. The dashboard allowed them to see all scouts, organized by troop, and view detailed information about each scout and their achievements.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>Results</h2>
                    <p>
                        With TeamMate, Dave and Chris could track all their scouts on one platform. Scouts and their families could easily check progress and achievements, keeping everyone motivated and connected.
