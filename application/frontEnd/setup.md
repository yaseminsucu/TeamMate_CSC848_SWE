# This tutorial is meant to help set up the front-end app
We will be using react for the front end app
1. Please delete the package-lock.json file, you will not need it in the installation process
2. Once the file is deleted, navigate in the terminal inside 'my-app'
3. Once inside the 'my-app' directory, run "npm install", this will take the package.json content and automatically create the node_modules and the package-lock.json
4. To run the app, run "npm start"
